# Mainframe
The complete PHP framework

MainframePHP is a framework based on (and extending) CodeIgniter.
Mainframe is to CodeIgniter what Ubuntu is to Debian.

Most notable features:

* Rails inspired Assets pipeline. Automatically names & minifies CSS & JS.
* Helper functions to easily insert CSS & JS files in views.
* A plugin system that allows you to create independent and distributable micro-MVC-apps.
* An engine for themes allowing you to create independent themes with their corresponding assets. This allows you to easily change the appearance of your app without having to change your views.
